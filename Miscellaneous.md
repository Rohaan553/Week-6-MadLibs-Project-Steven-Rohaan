We created our version of the code of conduct. We considered ways for us to prevent someone from misusing the program for something terrible. We also thought ways to make it enjoyable as this program aims to bring joy, not fear, to the people. As for License, we decided to go for the MIT licenses as it is simple enough for our purposes. However, we did the paraphrase the MIT license to reduce the complexity of the language. We do include the original copy of the license as well as the URL for anyone to see.
